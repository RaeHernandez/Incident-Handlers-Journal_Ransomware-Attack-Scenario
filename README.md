# Incident Handler’s Journal – Ransomware Attack Scenario

This repository contains an incident handler’s journal entry created for a Coursera cybersecurity activity. The goal of this project was to analyze a ransomware incident at a small healthcare clinic and document the event using structured incident-response reporting. This entry demonstrates my ability to interpret attack details, apply the 5 W’s of incident documentation, and reflect on response considerations.

## 📌 Scenario Overview

A U.S. primary-care clinic experienced a major disruption after several employees noticed they could no longer access medical records and other essential files. Operations came to a halt, and a ransom note appeared on affected systems.  
The attackers, a known cybercriminal group targeting healthcare and transportation organizations, had gained entry through targeted phishing emails containing malicious attachments. Once inside, they deployed ransomware that encrypted critical patient data and forced the clinic to shut down its systems and seek external assistance.

This journal entry captures the details of the incident using a structured format aligned with incident-response best practices.
